EXCLUSIVE: Former grown-ish star Trevor Jackson is returning to the Disney fold, landing a sought-after new role on ABC’s venerable drama Grey’s Anatomy.

He will will make his Grey’s debut in Episode 2117, the penultimate of the season airing May 8, and will also appear in the Season 21 finale with an option to become a series regular if the medical drama is renewed for a 22nd season. As Deadline reported yesterday, that is fully expected and may happen as soon as later this week.

On Grey’s Anatomy, Jackson will play a handsome, intelligent, but arrogant man in his late 20s who has just moved to Seattle. It is unclear whether the character is a new surgical intern/resident. That is a possibility as the show is down one of each following the departures of Mika (Midori Francis) and Levi (Jake Borelli) earlier this season.

The new role was pursued by a number of young actors as the opportunity to join a long-running hit of the caliber of Grey’s Anatomy does not come along very often.

Actor-singer Jackson starred opposite Yara Shahidi on Kenya Barris’ black-ish spinoff for Freeform grown-ish. He was the only original cast member to remain a series regular for the popular comedy’s entire six-season run. Before that, Jackson was a main cast member on another Disney series from the studio behind Grey’s Anatomy and the black-ish franchise as he starred opposite Regina King in Season 2 of John Ridley’s ABC anthology series American Crime.

Jackson, who started his career as a child actor, playing Young Simba on the touring Broadway production of The Lion King, later starred in the Broadway musical The Tap Dance Kid. He is repped by Independent Artist Group and Myman Greenspan Fox.

FULL ARTICLE TEXT:
Hulu has officially ordered The Handmaid’s Tale follow-up The Testaments to series with production set to begin on April 7. From executive producers Bruce Miller and Warren Littlefield, the drama is based on the 2019 Margaret Atwood novel of the same name set in the dystopian theocracy of Gilead more than 15 years after the events of The Handmaid’s Tale.

The Handmaid’s Tale lead Elisabeth Moss will also executive produce the project. As Deadline previously reported, the hope is for Moss to guest star in the sequel, reprising the role of June Osbourne, who is linked to Agnes and Daisy. With The Handmaid’s Tale set to premiere its final season on April 8, appearances from June will depend on whether she survives the rebellion unless they opt to go the flashback route.

The Testaments also rounds out its cast with 9 new actors: Mabel Li, Amy Seimetz, Brad Alexander, Zarrin Darnell-Martin, Eva Foote, Isolde Ardies, Shechinah Mpumlwana, Birva Pandya, and Kira Guloien.

The coming-of-age story finds a new generation of young women in Gilead, grappling with the bleak future that awaits them. For these young women, growing up in Gilead is all they have ever known, having no tangible memories of the outside world before their indoctrination into this life. Facing the prospect of being married off and living a life of servitude, they will be forced to search for allies, both new and old, to help in their fight for freedom and the life they deserve.

The previously announced principal cast includes Chase Infiniti as Agnes, Lucy Halliday as Daisy, Ann Dowd reprising her The Handmaid’s Tale role of Aunt Lydia, Rowan Blanchard as Shunammite and Mattea Conforti as Becka.

Here are description of the new actors’ characters:

Li plays Aunt Vidala, a stern disciplinarian and the heir-apparent to the women’s sphere of Gilead. Seimetz plays Paula, whose recent marriage to a high-ranking Commander has raised her social status. But her perfect life is complicated by her new step-daughter. Alexander plays Garth, a young Commander, who becomes involved in the personal lives of the girls he’s sworn to protect. Darnell-Martin plays Aunt Gabbana, a firm proponent of Gilead values and right-hand to Aunt Vidala. She is a strict and uncompromising educator. Foote plays Aunt Estee, the youngest Aunt, whose energy and kindness earn her “cool Aunt” status amongst her students. Ardies plays Hulda, a guileless girl, full of excitement at the prospect of womanhood. Her frank observations and optimism have earned her loyal friends. Mpumlwana plays Jehosheba, a competitive classmate from a respected family who is relentless in her pursuit of a high-status marriage. Pandya plays Miriam, a girl on the cusp of womanhood who struggles under the pressure of marriage season. Guloien plays Rosa, a caring and dedicated Martha, a maternal figure to Agnes and a much-needed source of love in an otherwise cold household.

The Testaments is created by showrunner Miller, who executive produces alongside Littlefield, Moss, Steve Stark, Shana Stein, Maya Goldsmith, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, Daniel Wilson, Fran Sears, and Mike Barker, who will also direct the first three episodes. Priscilla Poriand will serve as co-executive producer. The series is produced by MGM Television.

Her TV credits also include the hit Max comedy series Hacks, Peacock’s animated comedy series In the Know, Sundance TV’s Rectify, and HBO’s True Blood and Divorce.

On the big screen, Smith-Cameron played Joan in her husband Kenneth Lonergan’s 2011 film Margaret. She also starred in Blumhouse and Focus Feature’s thriller Vengeance, the directorial debut of B.J. Novak, and The Year Between, an independent drama feature from Alex Heller. Additional film credits include the Sundance-winning film Nancy opposite Andrea Riseborough, Steve Buscemi, and John Leguizamo, for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress.

So long yet again, Ava.

Tamara Braun revealed via Instagram that she’s leaving Days of Our Lives on April 3. Given that it’s April Fools, Deadline checked with the Peacock soap to make sure it’s true.

It is.

“I wish this was an April Fool’s Joke but it’s not,” Braun wrote on IG. “This is Ava’s last week on Days. Last couple of days really. Sad but true. I’ve been gone since late July of last year but you can still catch Ava on your screens until April 3rd! I miss being with my Days pals. They are a really good group of caring individuals and being with them was a joy.”

Braun originally joined DOOL back in 2008 in the role of Ava. She earned her first Daytime Emmy award in 2009 in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category.

The actress has been in and out of Salem for years. She returned in 2011 as Taylor Walker, taking over Natalia Livingston. In 2015, she reprised her role of Ava when DOOL was celebrating its 50th anniversary before leaving a year later. She then came back in 2020 and 2023.

“The change was solely due to the ebb and flow of daytime storytelling,” a DOOL spokesperson said about her most recent departure.

Braun has previously starred in other soaps like All My Children as Reese Williams and in General Hospital as Carly Corinthos and Kim Nero in separate runs.
